Step 1: Prepare Your Excel File
Open your Excel file and ensure that your roll numbers are listed in one column, say Column A.
Create a new sheet named "Marks" where marks will be entered.

Step 2: Enable Developer Tab
Go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon.
Check Developer in the right panel and click OK.

Step 3: Create the Form
Go to the Developer tab and click on Visual Basic.
In the VBA editor, click Insert > UserForm to create a new form.

Step 4: Design the Form
Add a TextBox for entering the roll number.
Add another TextBox for entering the marks.
Add a Button labeled "Submit".
Add a Label to display messages.

Step 5: Write the VBA Code
Here's a sample VBA code to achieve this functionality:

Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim rollNumber As String
    Dim mark As String
    Dim found As Range
    
    ' Set the worksheet where roll numbers are stored
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1") ' Change "Sheet1" to your sheet name
    rollNumber = RollNumberTextBox.Text
    mark = MarksTextBox.Text
    
    ' Search for the roll number
    Set found = ws.Range("A:A").Find(rollNumber, LookIn:=xlValues, LookAt:=xlWhole)
    
    If Not found Is Nothing Then
        ' Roll number found, enter marks
        ws.Cells(found.Row, 2).Value = mark ' Change 2 to the column where marks are to be entered
        MessageLabel.Caption = "Roll - " + rollNumber + "| Mark - " + mark + " inserted!"
        RollNumberTextBox.Text = ""
        MarksTextBox.Text = ""
    Else
        ' Roll number not found, show error message
        MessageLabel.Caption = "Please check the roll number " + rollNumber + " and try again."
        RollNumberTextBox.Text = ""
        MarksTextBox.Text = ""
    End If
End Sub

Step 6: Link the VBA Code to Your Form
Right-click on the "Submit" button and select View Code.
Paste the VBA code from Step 5 into the code editor.
Make sure your TextBox and Label names (RollNumberTextBox, MarksTextBox, MessageLabel) match those in your form.

Step 7: Test Your Form
Close the VBA editor and go back to your Excel file.
Press F5 or click Run in the VBA editor to test your form.

This setup will check the entered roll number against those available in your Excel sheet and display appropriate messages based on whether the roll number is found or not.
